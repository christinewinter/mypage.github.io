Today our keynote Errol Koolmeister, head of AI tech & architecture at [H&M Group](https://hmgroup.com/) and acting head of Data Science, shares how his work as a data scientist changed from crunching excel sheets to using AI pipelines in Production. Meet Errol on stag at the 6th PyCon Sweden at Münchenbryggeriet from 31st October to 1st November.

**Christine: Can you give some hints about the topic of your talk?**

**Errol:** In my talk I will share some of the learnings on setting up and scaling an AI function with a focus on the tech side. I will share how we create software that can go from a few markets in early proof of concept into global industrialization with a short timeline. I will share our architecture to accomplish this and highlight some of the success factors of our work.

**Christine: You were working as a data scientist throughout your whole career, what is it that fascinates you about data science?**

**Errol:** Well most of my professional life I have worked as a data scientist. What fascinates me is the insights we can derive from data and putting them into practical use. Becoming more relevant in general and being able to take informed decisions with the help of data.

**Christine: Which tips or tools would you recommend to data scientists to maximize their insights? Where could they use python?**

**Errol:** I am one of those that started out with excel… This was early in my career before I studied computer engineering and learned about SQL, databases and Java before finding Python 5+ years ago. The main speedup in my work came when I started saving my functions and generalizing them enough so that they could be reused as libraries. Spending a bit of time after each task to catch my learnings have really helped me improving the time to insights and action compared to a few years ago. Someone once told me that programming gives you superpowers and it is true. You constantly find new ways to process your data and new libraries are being created every day.

**Christine: As the lead of data science at H&M you are working with big data, where do you see challenges in setting up advanced analytics with AI all the way into production?**

**Errol:** The biggest challenge when working with large datasets is that you need to understand the practical implications of not fitting data into memory on your laptop or local server. You are entering the domain of distributed computing which adds an additional layer of complexity that will impact your code. These challenges are a bit easier today to handle ,compared to a few years ago, thanks to spark/pyspark. Other than that, the data science process is still the same. You are exploring your data, modelling it and then predicting the future. The main challenge is to do this in an efficient way. You need to write good code following best practices if you want to reach production and stay there.

**Christine: What was your favourite project/proof of concept that became real? And what factors made it successful?**

**Errol:** Well we have one project here at H&M that we started in January that just started delivering into production (September). The key success factors for that was that we started with a strong team that focused on the end to end process with software engineering best practices. So, creating an environment for data scientists to work with the exploratory part, feature engineering and modelling and then having a fully automated pipeline for training and prediction. The end result is really cool and I really enjoy watching the vision we created early in the year now delivering value.

**Christine: Where do you see data science in production develop in the future?**

**Errol:** We need to work more on how we handle our models in production. One of the big challenges right now is that we can create something that goes in production, but we are not that good in following up on the results or when we do the feedback loop is usually too long. This needs to improve for everything that goes into production. Things change and we need to understand that change and act accordingly.

**Christine: Which topics would you like to explore more further on?**

**Errol:** I would personally like to spend more time on graphs and explore how we can be better in using them. One of the topics I am really interested in but haven’t had the time to explore fully is knowledge graphs. They are really interesting concepts.

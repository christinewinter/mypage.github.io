&lt;p&gt;
    The disruption in the event industry this year did also hit our organizing team at &lt;a href=&quot;www.pycon.se&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PyCon Sweden 2020&lt;/a&gt; .
    Last year we arranged our biggest conference until then. A two day conference with 3 keynotes, 17 talks,
    4 workshops and 2 panel discussions at a venue in the heart of Stockholm. For 2020 we had similar plans
    and then in March everything changed. Since the conference is usually planned for the fall, we had some
    buffer to decide if we even want to consider an on-site conference. We quickly decided against it and to
    go fully online instead. This didn't reduce the planning and we had new points to consider opening our registration
    up to the world.&lt;br&gt;
    With a lot of energy and will we extended
    &lt;a href=&quot;www.pycon.se&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PyCon Sweden 2020&lt;/a&gt; and arranged a 2 day conference with multiple tracks,
    4 keynotes, 35 talks, 4 workshops and 2 panel discussions!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Here is a checklist of things we had to do to arrange a conference of this format.
    One can invest more time in many of those points, like extended marketing, a remarkable state of the art webpage,
    intense participant &amp; sponsor engagement and high entertainment in general.&lt;br&gt;
    This checklist is not fully complete. Still it should allow you to arrange a conference with the main points covered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt; 4 - 5 months before the conference:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;team&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;team&quot;&gt; Gather the team and set up regular meetings&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;notes&quot;&gt; Take notes during meetings, for example like
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/python-sverige/protokoll/blob/master/styrelsemote/boardmeeting-YYYY-MM-DD-template.md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;date&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;date&quot;&gt; Decide a date&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;size&quot;

    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;platform&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;platform&quot;&gt; Test and decide on a streaming platform&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;webpage&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;webpage&quot;&gt; Setup a web page&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt; 2 - 3 months before the conference:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;cfpopen&quot;&gt;

    &lt;label for=&quot;talksetup&quot;&gt; Set up broadcasts, background, links&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;onboarding&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;onboarding&quot;&gt; Volunteer On-boarding&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;calendar&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;calendar&quot;&gt; Calendar reminders during conference in Slack&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;rehearsals&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;rehearsals&quot;&gt; Speakers Rehearsals&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt; 1 week before the conference:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;moderation&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;moderation&quot;&gt; Prepare opening, closing and moderation&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;registrationclose&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;registrationclose&quot;&gt; Close Registration&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;prepare&quot;&gt;

    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;publish3&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;publish3&quot;&gt; Publish on social media reminders&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;communication&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;communication&quot;&gt; Clearify team communication and responsibilities&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt; Conference day:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;golive&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;golive&quot;&gt; Go live&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;feedbackask&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;feedbackask&quot;&gt; Ask for feedback&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;debrief&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;debrief&quot;&gt; Debrief and celebrate&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt; 1 week after the conference:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;feedback&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;feedback&quot;&gt; Analyse feedback&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;retrospect&quot;&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;retrospect&quot;&gt; Retrospect and lessons learned&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Of course there are many more things that one could do during preparation time or the conference iteself .
    And if there is not a lack of anything it is ideas.
    However keep in mind, that the time and energy you can spend on an event like this is
    highly dependent on the amount and availability of voluntarily work.&lt;br&gt;
    Since we want to keep our heads cool during the conference itself it is wise to prioritise and strike certain
    points out in order to give others enough attention. If things go terribly wrong and we are already at maximum
    capacity it could mean a total meltdown for some of us and would destroy our team dynamic drastically.
    &lt;br&gt;
    At PyCon Sweden we were incredibly lucky that we found committed volunteers that took full ownership to ensure a
    great experience both for the speakers and the audience. And I am thankful for each single contribution!
    &lt;br&gt;
    There are always some hick-ups here and there, especially with technic involved it usually doesn't get easier.
    A muted microphone, multiple posts with the same content, loss of connection up to a surrendering computer.&lt;br&gt;
    But honestly isn't exactly that the delightful and exciting part of a live conference?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    I hope you found the checklist usable and wish you good luck for your online event or conference!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    All the best, &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    In spring in 2019, I hold my first public presentation at PyLadies
    Sthlm that became a rolling snowball for the rest of 2019.
    &lt;br&gt;
    After the event the meetup organizer asked me, if I would be interested
    in organising future events of PyLadies Sthlm. That sounded fun and
    like a unique chance to meet new people and learn about different
    topics from the Python world. I had no idea how to organize a
    meetup, but a rough plan and some input from other PyLadies.
    &lt;br&gt;
    We needed one or two speakers, a place, a time and a number of
    participants. That was easy to fix, my colleague + one PyLady
    organizer would give a talk, they had time the same day in August,
    I got the rooms and food sponsored from my workplace and 30 people
    could join.
    &lt;br&gt;
    Perfect! All set, people were happy with the event and
    I as well. All in all a great success!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Level up!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    In the week after that event the chair woman of PyCon Sweden
    reached out to me for a collaboration of PyLadies Sthlm and PyCon Sweden.
    PyCon Sweden arranges the annual Python conference
    in Sweden, usually in Stockholm. Wow, that came quite unexpected. I just
    started to understand how to arrange a two-hour meetup, but arranging
    a two-day conference was a completely different league. The team had
    already prepared a lot and established a structured
    way to get things done.
    &lt;br&gt;
    My responsibilities were arranging two panel discussions,
    interview our keynotes and update the social media channels during the conference.
    I never done any of these things before... Especially during the panel
    I had to face my biggest fear, be spontaneous. I like being prepared and
    thanks to the internet and Wiki-How I got a lot info and confidence on the way.
    In the end it became a great experience. &lt;br&gt;
    This year I am in the organising team again and responsible of keynotes, moderation of their talks and
    communication via social media, which is an area I explore for some time already.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What you can learn from organizing events?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Expertise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    This is by far the most obvious point, still by dedicating your time to prepare a presentation of a topic
    you take ownership of your own learning. Spending time to understand and being able to formulate a concept
    in you own words is a great way of learning. If you are not an expert in a certain area yet, it is a good idea to
    start gathering material for a beginners course and extend the content as your own knowledge grows. Holding a presentation
    doesn't mean that you have to be able to answer EVERY question you get from the audience.
    It is completely fine to say, sorry I am not sure, I will come back to you about. Then look it up and again, you learned
    something new.
    &lt;br&gt;
    If you have nothing that you want to present yourself, you can still arrange an event and see if there are
    other people that want to present their topic. Support them as much as you can and ask them questions and I bet they
    will be happy to explain you more details.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Personality boost&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Being the organizer definitely helps to build self-confidence by caring
    responsibility. Responsibility is scary, but it's that challenge that
    can enable growth. You have to take decisions and actions to ensure
    that your speakers and hosts get the best support to make the event
    a success. You also have to answer a couple of questions, where you have to take decisions yourself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Relationships &amp; Network&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    You can build great relations, with speakers, hosts, attendees and
    sponsors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The hardest part for me at meetups and conferences at the beginning was to start a
    conversation with random strangers. If you are an organizer people come
    to you instead to say &quot;Hi&quot; and share ideas. Especially at PyCon Sweden where
    the organizers were wearing a pink shirt to stick out of the crowd.
    I have to say that over time I even started to enjoy mingling!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    I can really recommend everybody to get active in your local
    community. Go to meetups and conferences and support the people
    daring to step on stage. Study how they hold presentations and
    prepare one yourself for a local meetup of group that you trust.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    There is so much we can learn from each other, that is not possible
    to acquire from online courses or programming only. The interaction
    with people face to face gives the opportunity to ask more questions
    and understand peoples thoughts, experiences and opinions in a much
    more engaging way. And who knows maybe you make some friends too...
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    All the best,
    &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Recently I discovered a
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_harford_a_powerful_way_to_unleash_your_natural_creativity/transcript&quot;&gt;
        TED talk
    &lt;/a&gt;
    by Tim Harford that inspired me. He explains the concept of slow
    multitasking as a creative tool. In a nutshell it is working on different projects over a long period
    of time. The projects could go on for weeks, months, years depending on how much time they need to be
    finished. Some never finish and that is also okay.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    I love this concept! My whole life I was struggling to limit my interests because I though you can only be
    good at something if I focus on it fully. The way ordinary careers are structured by finishing school,
    selecting a profession and pursuing one path until retirement always freaked me out. I wanted to see life in a
    continuous exploration. Throughout my studies and later my work days I had a lot of ideas and interests
    popping up in my head. I thought I could become a piano player, a painter, a photographer, a surfer, a writer
    or a machine learning pioneer. I wanted to be everything but I stopped exploring the sideways because I thought
    these activities would be misleading and stealing time from my actual tasks that I have to do to become a better
    developer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Life is not limited to one career path and a job title. With the concept of slow multitasking I no longer feel
    like have to limit myself and instead I can can allocate time and energy for projects I am interested in.
    My best example is this blog. Because for being creative it is not important
    if you think about doing one certain thing the rest of your life. Instead it is important that you start doing
    something in the first place and let your passion drive you on the way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Think about it. What will your passion project be for the next weeks? And why don't just start today?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    All the best,

&lt;p&gt;
    Programming is a challenge for the mind. Not only because of the complexity of systems or features we are building,
    but also because of the setup. Most people program alone and that not always by choice. Many teams
    I have seen split up problems into smaller tasks that get implemented by one person each. The idea seems nice.
    We have a lot of work and by the divide and conquer approach we work faster towards the common goal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The drawback of this setup is, that this follows a lot of alone time with focus on getting thoughts into code.
    With code comes bugs and with more bugs and more code comes more and more frustration.
    And frustration was never known to be a constructive driver for qualitative programming but rather nourishes
    self-doubt. Like a tiny voice telling us that we are an imposter, that we are not as smart as our peers and
    should have become travel bloggers instead of a developers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Heads up, many of us have been there too. And will end up there again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    But what to do?
    How do we stay on the problem anyway, find the cause of bugs or continue
    coding until everything work as we want it and not just throw the towel into the ring?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Recently I stumbled over Angela Duckworth’s TED talk about GRIT. She studies the reason that makes people successful and why.
    Are there common patterns that apply to those people?
    What do they do differently than others?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    She found out that there is a relation of talent, effort and skill.
    With an initial talent we need less effort to learn a certain skill, but if we put a lot of effort into
    learning, talent can be outperformed. The motivation to go the extra mile and put effort into improvement
    she describes as grit, the combination of passion and perseverance, the will to push forward to become better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Isn't that great news?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    I found her description of grit inspiring, because it destroys the finality of learning and its dependency
    on talent. The brain is plastic. It has the ability to adapt and change. So, if you have a vision of your
    goal and spend the energy to progress and improve you will go further and further and improve your skill.
    &lt;br&gt;
    Programming is a skill like any other. With enough time and a curious mind, you will master it and fix the bugs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Keep that in mind when frustration is building up again and you feel like giving up.
    It's yet another step on the way to the solution and you will learn a lot from this experience.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">An Ice Cube about Grit Programming is a challenge for the mind. Not only because of the complexity of systems or features we are building, but also because of the setup. Most people program alone and that not always by choice. Many teams I have seen split up problems into smaller tasks that get implemented by one person each. The idea seems nice. We have a lot of work and by the divide and conquer approach we work faster towards the common goal. The drawback of this setup is, that this follows a lot of alone time with focus on getting thoughts into code. With code comes bugs and with more bugs and more code comes more and more frustration. And frustration was never known to be a constructive driver for qualitative programming but rather nourishes self-doubt. Like a tiny voice telling us that we are an imposter, that we are not as smart as our peers and should have become travel bloggers instead of a developers. Heads up, many of us have been there too.

And welcome on Ice Cubes!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    My name is Christine, a software developer who besides coding in Python
    likes to make puns on her last name (Winter).
   &lt;br&gt;
    As an ambivert I also enjoy organising tech events like
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesStockholm/&quot;&gt;PyLadies Sthlm&lt;/a&gt;
    and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pycon.se&quot;&gt;PyCon Sweden&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    I care about the people I meet and work with. Therefore I always want to
    create an atmosphere where everybody feels welcomed and connected.
    In that way we can have interesting discussions and pick up exciting
    challenges together. And most of all, we will celebrate our successes
    as well as learn new skills on the way and grow as people.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    With this page I want to inspire you who might be interested in tech and
    just leak a bit of tools to get started. I hope you find some inspiring
    project ideas to learn tech in a fun way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Again a very warm welcome and if you have any topic that you want me
    to cover, feel free to reach out via the contact form or email.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    All the best,
    &lt;br&gt;

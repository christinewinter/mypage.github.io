<h2>Talk first, do more.</h2>
<p>
    In spring in 2019, I hold my first public presentation at PyLadies
    Sthlm that became a rolling snowball for the rest of 2019.
    <br>
    After the event the meetup organizer asked me, if I would be interested
    in organising future events of PyLadies Sthlm. That sounded fun and
    like a unique chance to meet new people and learn about different
    topics from the Python world. I had no idea how to organize a
    meetup, but a rough plan and some input from other PyLadies.
    <br>
    We needed one or two speakers, a place, a time and a number of
    participants. That was easy to fix, my colleague + one PyLady
    organizer would give a talk, they had time the same day in August,
    I got the rooms and food sponsored from my workplace and 30 people
    could join.
    <br>
    Perfect! All set, people were happy with the event and
    I as well. All in all a great success!
</p>

<h2>Level up!</h2>
<p>
    In the week after that event the chair woman of PyCon Sweden
    reached out to me for a collaboration of PyLadies Sthlm and PyCon Sweden.
    PyCon Sweden arranges the annual Python conference
    in Sweden, usually in Stockholm. Wow, that came quite unexpected. I just
    started to understand how to arrange a two-hour meetup, but arranging
    a two-day conference was a completely different league. The team had
    already prepared a lot and established a structured
    way to get things done.
    <br>
    My responsibilities were arranging two panel discussions,
    interview our keynotes and update the social media channels during the conference.
    I never done any of these things before... Especially during the panel
    I had to face my biggest fear, be spontaneous. I like being prepared and
    thanks to the internet and Wiki-How I got a lot info and confidence on the way.
    In the end it became a great experience. <br>
    This year I am in the organising team again and responsible of keynotes, moderation of their talks and
    communication via social media, which is an area I explore for some time already.

<h2>What you can learn from organizing events?</h2>

<h3>Expertise</h3>
<p>
    This is by far the most obvious point, still by dedicating your time to prepare a presentation of a topic
    you take ownership of your own learning. Spending time to understand and being able to formulate a concept
    in you own words is a great way of learning. If you are not an expert in a certain area yet, it is a good idea to
    start gathering material for a beginners course and extend the content as your own knowledge grows. Holding a presentation
    doesn't mean that you have to be able to answer EVERY question you get from the audience.
    It is completely fine to say, sorry I am not sure, I will come back to you about. Then look it up and again, you learned
    something new.
    <br>
    If you have nothing that you want to present yourself, you can still arrange an event and see if there are
    other people that want to present their topic. Support them as much as you can and ask them questions and I bet they
    will be happy to explain you more details.
</p>

<h3>Personality boost</h3>
<p>
    Being the organizer definitely helps to build self-confidence by caring
    responsibility. Responsibility is scary, but it's that challenge that
    can enable growth. You have to take decisions and actions to ensure
    that your speakers and hosts get the best support to make the event
    a success. You also have to answer a couple of questions, where you have to take decisions yourself.
</p>

<h3>Relationships & Network</h3>
<p>
    You can build great relations, with speakers, hosts, attendees and
    sponsors.
</p>
<p>
    The hardest part for me at meetups and conferences at the beginning was to start a
    conversation with random strangers. If you are an organizer people come
    to you instead to say "Hi" and share ideas. Especially at PyCon Sweden where
    the organizers were wearing a pink shirt to stick out of the crowd.
    I have to say that over time I even started to enjoy mingling!
</p>
<p>
    I can really recommend everybody to get active in your local
    community. Go to meetups and conferences and support the people
    daring to step on stage. Study how they hold presentations and
    prepare one yourself for a local meetup of group that you trust.
</p>
<p>
    There is so much we can learn from each other, that is not possible
    to acquire from online courses or programming only. The interaction
    with people face to face gives the opportunity to ask more questions
    and understand peoples thoughts, experiences and opinions in a much
    more engaging way. And who knows maybe you make some friends too...
</p>
<p>
    All the best,
    <br>

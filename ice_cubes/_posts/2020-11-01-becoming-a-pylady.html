<h2>Stepping into the Python community</h2>
<p>
In spring 2019 I was ready for change. I was tired of learning alone after spending way too much time
    participating online courses about data, visualisation and machine learning. It was time to step out
    and pick up a challenge. At my workplace we had Lunch & Learn now and then, an occasion where everybody
    who wanted could present a topic, while the rest were eating their wrap or salad. I presented an introduction
    to machine learning (ML) with a decision tree example. ML was and is still one of my major interest but I
    didn’t use it in my actual work as a software programmer.<br>
    The presentation went very well and I received a lot of feedback and tips what to explore next. It even lead
    through an internal project where we were using an ML algorithm for data classification, that I was leading.
</p>
<p>
Before my talk I joined PyLadies, a non-binary mentorship group for Python programmers and thought I could give a
    similar presentation there. I reached out to Éléonore who was organising events regularly to know if this would
    be a topic of interest. I had recently joined PyLadies and really liked the atmosphere of respect, curiosity
    and allowing members to try things out.
After the presentation the Éléonore asked me if I wanted to arrange similar events in the future and without
    thinking I answered “Yes sure, why not?!". I didn’t know how to do that and what that means. However I had
    a lot of trust that I would get the support that I needed.
</p>
<p>
Easy as that, suddenly I was in. And since then I organised events and had the goal to meet at least once a month.
    During events I got asked by speakers that wanted to present and contacted companies that were interested in
    hosting those kind of events, so there was always an event up in the pipeline. I got very glad when there were
    new PyLadies joining the organising team, so that we can do more in the future.
Through my work with PyLadies I also got in contact with PyCon Sweden, a non-profit organisation arranging an
    annual conference for the Python community in Sweden. The organiser team has a very welcoming group culture,
    where people decide which tasks and responsibilities they want to take over. Members get a lot of trust and
    freedom in doing their tasks. This year I joined for the second time and I was picking up new tasks and took
    more ownership, which makes me feel even more involved in the local Python community.
</p>
<p>
With the pandemic situations limiting the options to meet up most events have moved online. Since we don’t have the
    natural way of meeting and chatting at PyLadies I am now reaching out to persons that I know have something
    interesting to present.
To adapt to that new situation and continue organising the events and keep the atmosphere of learning and exploring
    I explored with the concept of the “PyLadies Online Mingle” where we can talk about ideas, tech and whatever
    comes in mind. At one of those events I found one brave member alias magicandcode who wanted to give a talk and
    Alexandra who is currently organising a study group for data analysis in Python.
So I have high hopes that we will continue with interesting and engaging events online at least until we are able
    to run face-to-face events again.

If you want to give a presentation at PyLadies Stockholm, feel free to reach out to me.

All the best,

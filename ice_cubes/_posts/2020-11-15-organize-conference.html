<h2>Conferences in Times of Corona</h2>
<p>
    The disruption in the event industry this year did also hit our organizing team at <a href="www.pycon.se" target="_blank">PyCon Sweden 2020</a> .
    Last year we arranged our biggest conference until then. A two day conference with 3 keynotes, 17 talks,
    4 workshops and 2 panel discussions at a venue in the heart of Stockholm. For 2020 we had similar plans
    and then in March everything changed. Since the conference is usually planned for the fall, we had some
    buffer to decide if we even want to consider an on-site conference. We quickly decided against it and to
    go fully online instead. This didn't reduce the planning and we had new points to consider opening our registration
    up to the world.<br>
    With a lot of energy and will we extended
    <a href="www.pycon.se" target="_blank">PyCon Sweden 2020</a> and arranged a 2 day conference with multiple tracks,
    4 keynotes, 35 talks, 4 workshops and 2 panel discussions!
</p>
<p>
    Here is a checklist of things we had to do to arrange a conference of this format.
    One can invest more time in many of those points, like extended marketing, a remarkable state of the art webpage,
    intense participant & sponsor engagement and high entertainment in general.<br>
    This checklist is not fully complete. Still it should allow you to arrange a conference with the main points covered.

    Of course there are many more things that one could do during preparation time or the conference.
    And if there is not a lack of anything it is ideas.
    However keep in mind, that the time and energy you can spend on an event like this is
    highly dependent on the amount and availability of voluntarily work.<br>
    Since we want to keep our heads cool during the conference itself it is wise to prioritise and strike certain
    points out in order to give others enough attention. If things go terribly wrong and we are already at maximum
    capacity it could mean a total meltdown for some of us and would destroy our team dynamic drastically.
    <br>
    At PyCon Sweden we were incredibly lucky that we found committed volunteers that took full ownership to ensure a
    great experience both for the speakers and the audience. And I am thankful for each single contribution!
    <br>
    There are always some hick-ups here and there, especially with technic involved it usually doesn't get easier.
    A muted microphone, multiple posts with the same content, loss of connection up to a surrendering computer.<br>
    But honestly isn't exactly that the delightful and exciting part of a live conference?
</p>
<p>
    I hope you found the checklist usable and wish you good luck for your online event or conference!
</p>
<p>
    All the best, <br>

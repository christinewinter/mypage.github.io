<h2>Where to start when learning programming with Python</h2>
<p>
    As usual, when starting looking for information when learning a new skill or about a new topic, it's difficult to
    find relevant resources.
</p>
<p>
    Especially technical topics can feel intimidating to even start in the first place.
</p>
<p>
    Python wasn't the first programming language I learned, but it is by far my favorite. Python is volatile language
    that can be used in many different topics you can dive into after understanding the basics, like math & statistics
    with Python, data processing, machine learning, web-programming and embedded programming. But before that, one has
    to get started.
</p>
<p>
    As a Python ambassador I often get questions about where to find useful resources. In this post I won't explain
    the details of Python, but rather want to point to resources that I found helpful to get started. Also this is a
    living list, meaning that I keep the freedom to update and extend it from time to time.
</p>

<h4>Getting started</h4>
<p>
    If you never have written a line of code and approach Python as your first programming language, then you can have
    a look at the following links. Please don't go through all of the tutorials and books. Choose one or two of them
    depending on the format that you learn from best:
</p>

<h4>Web pages:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.learnpython.org/" target="_blank">https://www.learnpython.org/</a> <br>
        An interactive web page, were you can get a grasp of the language and structure without any need to set something up.
        It's great to just get started without struggling to find the right tools or installation files.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp" target="_blank">
            https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp</a> <br>
        A more general introduction to the language, you can check out on W3School, which is the go to side of web
        programming basics.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Books (online):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.py4e.com/" target="_blank">https://www.py4e.com/</a> <br>
        All material for the book "Python for Everybody" by Dr. Charles R. Severance, with also a PDF version
        available linked from that page <br>
        <a href="http://do1.dr-chuck.com/pythonlearn/EN_us/pythonlearn.pdf" target="_blank">
            http://do1.dr-chuck.com/pythonlearn/EN_us/pythonlearn.pdf</a> <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/" target="_blank">
            https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/</a> <br>
        "Think Python" by Allen B. Downey introducing programming and Python for beginners.
    </li>
</ul>


<h4>Courses & Tutorials:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://realpython.com/python-first-steps/" target="_blank">https://realpython.com/python-first-steps/ </a> <br>
        A lot of free tutorials and information available without a paid membership.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python" target="_blank">
            https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python</a> <br>
        Respective course from the author "Python for Everybody" by Dr. Charles R. Severance on Coursera.
        Choosing the certificate option might require payment.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    After writing some lines of code or maybe just a single one you will run into problems and that is a crucial
    part of the learning process. Embrace your errors as a learning opportunity.
</p>

<h4>Troubleshooting:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">www.stackoverflow.com</a> <br>
        Maybe the largest forum for developers, where people share and discuss their code, architecture,
        error messages, careers and more
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/debugging.html" target="_blank">
            https://www.fullstackpython.com/debugging.html
        </a> <br>
        Learn how to debug and understand the tools
    </li>
    <li>
        Local Python communities like
        <a href="https://www.python.org/events/python-user-group/" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/events/python-user-group/</a> <br>
        and
        <a href="https://pyladies.com/locations/" target="_blank">https://pyladies.com/locations/</a> <br>
         to meet your peers, share and discuss
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Very few programmers are writing code with only an editor and command line. If you want to use a proper
    IDE (integrated development environment) or avoid installing Python on your computer locally, have a look at
    the following links. Again choose one and try it out for a bit, don't fall in the trap to get obsessed with tools.
</p>

<h4>Writing code:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/" target="_blank">https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/</a> <br>
        <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/" target="_blank">https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/</a> <br>
        Most popular editors for Python PyCharm and Visual Studio
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb" target="_blank">https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb</a> <br>
        With a google account you can code in the cloud without the need to install Python locally
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://mybinder.org/" target="_blank">https://mybinder.org/</a> <br>
        Interactive code with Jupyter notebooks in the browser (needs pre-existing code in form of a Github repository)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    I really hope you found a starting point for your learning journey and enjoy exploring the world of Python and programming in general.
</p>
<p>
    Happy learning and let me know how it goes!
</p>
<p>
    All the best,
    <br>

<h2>Frosty greetings! This is me.</h2>
<p>
    My name is Christine, a software developer who besides coding in Python
    likes to organise tech events like
    <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesStockholm/">PyLadies Sthlm</a>
    and <a href="https://www.pycon.se">PyCon Sweden</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I care about the people I meet and work with. Therefore I always want to
    create an atmosphere where everybody feels welcomed and connected.
    In that way we can have interesting discussions and pick up exciting
    challenges together. And most of all, we will celebrate our successes
    as well as learn new skills on the way and grow as people.
</p>
<p>
    With this page I want to inspire you who might be interested in tech and
    just leak a bit of tools to get started. I hope you find some inspiring
    project ideas to learn tech in a fun way.

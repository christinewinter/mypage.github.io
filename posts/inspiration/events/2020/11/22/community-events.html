        <h2>Shaping the Community</h2>
<p>
    In a previous post I told my story about becoming a PyLady, first as a speaker and later as an event
    organiser of PyLadies Stockholm and PyCon Sweden. This time I want to share my motivation that gives
    me the energy and why I encourage you to try out to arrange such kind of community events.
</p>

<h4>Meeting People</h4>
<p>
	This is by far the most obvious point of motivation. The main reason I like organizing events is meeting to
    new people. That doesn't mean that I go to everyone who joins and bother with a conversation. Being the organizer
    allows me to get in contact with speakers, other organizers and volunteers. Since I was struggling in the beginning
    to find my sense of belonging in the tech community, knowing a bunch of people helped me definitely to feel more
    at home.<br>
	There are times when I am unsure about where I want to go in my career, then I take the chance and ask people
    directly what tasks and responsibilities they have in their roles. Do you know what it means to be a data
    scientist, software engineer, UX designer or the CTO of a new startup?
	I am so thankful about those precious insights.
</p>

<h4>Level up on Leadership</h4>
<p>
    Arranging events needs some form of leadership. For most events with PyLadies Sthlm I had to keep a couple
    of people in the loop beforehand. Starting with the organizer team, to speakers who provide the content and
    sponsors hosting us. That means I have to formulate a vision of the event, answering questions and taking
    decision and eventually decision by myself. Just because I have arranged a couple of events it's not obvious
    to others what the procedure is. So over time I became a better communicator by explaining and listening.
</p>

<h4>Level up on Tech Knowledge </h4>
<p>
    By attending tech events I always learn something new. Either a new concept, or if I already know it some more
    details or different application.
    Hearing the content being presented in real time feels more engaging and goes beyond the frontal approach of
    online courses and documentation web sites, because there is somebody I can ask questions directly.
    I always leave events inspired and with 100 ideas of possible projects and feel also like I see where tech
    trends might go and which skills might be good to develop next.
</p>

<h4>Trying things out</h4>
<p>
    Events go beyond the meetup platform. Most groups have a web site or social media presents.
	Public relations and communication is nothing I studies formally. However I can try it out by writing meetup
    description, do some web programming, video streaming and get better over time and learn the tools.
</p>

<h4>Growth & Appreciation</h4>
<p>
    For me it's a big reward seeing people grow. Especially the ones that haven't done such kind of talk or
    workshop before and dare to take up that challenge. I know that speaking in public is terrifying for most
    people and I want to give as much as support needed so that speakers feel comfortable with the situation
    knowing there is one alley in the audience. For me that means that I am available for a dry runs of the
    presentation, prepare some questions to initiate the discussion and give some feedback if wanted.
    <br>
    Standing in front of the crowd that has high expectations about the event and moderate and initiate discussion
    gave me a push to grow as a person.
    <br>
	Usually people appreciate having a place to meet their peers and learn more about the subject they are interested
    in. Getting this appreciation and seeing how other people finding each other makes me happy since I feel a little
    bit like I am the one enabling this experience.
</p>
<p>
    In the end my goal is to build a community where others also feel like they belong here, where they feel save
    and get brave to try out. With every coming meetup we get a bit closer to that goal.
</p>
<p>
    What event would you like to see happening? And what stops you in trying out to arrange yourself?
    <br>
    I am sure it will be a great experience!
</p>
<p>
    All the best, <br>
    Christine
